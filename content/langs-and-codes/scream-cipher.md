# Scream Cipher

A substitution cipher for the 26-letter English alphabet.

It was made by xkcd.com, seemingly as a joke based on the fact that all text in Scream Cipher looks kind of like screaming.

The cipher appeared in an xkcd web comic released on February 21st, 2025. The comic featured an image displaying the cipher with one person texting "" to another, who replies "".

The image comic featured the following mouseover text: "AAAAAA A ÃA̧AȂA̦ ǍÅÂÃĀÁȂ AAAAAAA!"

The image also has the following text below it: "In the Scream Cipher, messages consist of all As, with different letters distinguished using diacritics."
