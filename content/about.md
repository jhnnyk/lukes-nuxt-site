<h2>About</h2>

# Hello, I'm Luke Knotts

...and this is my website, dedicated to various endeavors of mine. It was started as a place to put my <a class="inline-link" href="/devloghome">game development blog</a>, as well as my (unfinished) text-based game, <a class="inline-link" href="projects/dontgooutside">Don't Go Outside</a>. I am currently studying game development, focusing on design.

Perhaps I should mention that there have been some other weirdos with my name floating around. I have no ties to any of the other ones named Luke Knotts. Not to the one who plays soccer, nor any of the ones who have passed away.
