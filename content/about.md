# About

# Hello, I'm Luke Knotts,

...and this is my website, dedicated to various endeavors of mine. It was started as a place to put my <a class="inline-link" href="/devlog/devloghome">game development log</a>, as well as my (unfinished) text-based game, <a class="inline-link" href="https://dontgooutside.lukeknotts.com">Don't Go Outside</a>. I am currently studying game development, focusing on design.

This website was created by John Knotts and Luke Knotts.
