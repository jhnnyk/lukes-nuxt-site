Hiya kids!

This entry covers a couple days of work, and is a little later than intended. After seeing a fellow game developer make a few music tracks for their game, I've been inspired. Over the last few days, I finally put something together and made a draft of some background music for our project.

It took me a while to find sounds that I liked, but after I Googled the chord progression of a song I was inspired by, I had a good place to start from. It was not until I started messing around in some music-making software that I found a melody I liked, and really put something together. I plan to get feedback from the rest of the team on what I wrote.

Above is the background music draft.

During these few days, we added a start screen. Previously, our game started by dropping the player into our game's world with no context whatsoever. I think having a start screen helps prepare the player to start playing the game. I was suprirsed when one of our coders showed me the start screen, as it was much more elaborate than I had intended, and communicated a much darker vibe. Perhaps I should have been more clear, or maybe I should have drilled in that we just needed a <i>placeholder</i> start screen.

We also ran into another problem. The temporary lighting that a programmer had implemented during the first few days of development turns out to be super laggy. Apparently calculating shadows takes a lot of computer power. One of our artists spent a good deal of time learning about the lighting system in Unreal Engine, and fixing our game's lighting.

Additionally, to slight sadness from me, we reduced the overall goal of the project to be less ambitious. The original story I had written up was quite large, so shrinking the project into something smaller seems necessary if we want to have a game that's mostly finished by our deadline. I still think our new plan is ambitious and will be a lot of fun, though. Wish us luck!

<h1>MATH: Data</h1>

Welcome, all! This is another one of our famous MATH SEGMENTS! Today we're talking about data. Now that we have a playable DEMO of our project, we are recieving data from playtests, and so we can improve our game accordingly.

One thing that we learned is that the controls of the game are not intuitive. When people played our game, they didn't understand how to do things. Despite showing the controls onscreen, it will still pretty confusing, and didn't feel natural to play. (I felt this too...)

During these times, our team is watching what people do. After our first outside playtest, I immediately made a note of new things to do. In one part of our DEMO, you have to fill out a piece of paper. The controls for this segment confused everyone who played it. So, it should be altered so that filling out a piece of paper feels less awkward.

Additionally, we found that the idea of clicking to pick up a coffee was confusing. Everybody found it awkward that they were told to look into their inventory before they had any items. So, I think we should potentially add additional instructions, and wait to tell the player about their inventory until after they have an item in their inventory.

Seeing how things work to people who have never played our game is super informative, and very interesting! I think having people playtest our project has already contributed to a better overall project.

And with that, I'll end this post.
