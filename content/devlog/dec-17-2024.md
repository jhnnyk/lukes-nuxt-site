Our game jam is basically over now. The team I was on, working on "Wolrd Thumb Boxing," was unfortunately not able to finished a project. I think there were too many complicated mechanics that we were trying to pull together at once, so we didn't ever get to a point where we had something we could play. If I were to do it again, I would try to get the team to make something stupidly simplified but playable, so we could work from there and at least have something to submit for the jam.

For this project, I helped document the mechanics, and loosely keep track of everything that we needed to work on. I also spent a lot of time (maybe too much time) working on music, as well as some pixel art graphics (mostly doing the graphics for the in-game buttons and things).

Here are the pieces of music I made for the jam. I feel like I learned a good bit while making these (especially that I maybe should have "killed my darlings"), and even though I found some parts difficult, I think I learned something.

I also made some sprites, so I'll share those below as well.

<span class="image-desc">Some pixel art sprites I made for our game jam project. I'm proud of what I did.</span>

Even though our team didn't create a finish product, I do feel like I learned some things, and am glad I got to work on a project like this. I also got to work with some cool people, so I'm happy to get to know my fellow game devlopers better.

I'm glad I got to do some music for a project, and I was happy with how well my pixel art turned out. The only thing I regret is not getting more involved in the project, and helping push for a playable version of the game ASAP.

There's no MATH SEGMENT for today, so I thanks for reading!
