This week it was announced that the deadline for our game is nearing. Our team has known this, of course, but it's still scary to hear.

All of our groups met and discussed the upcoming deadline, and how much time we have left. Immediately afterwards me and the rest of Team ERASE privately met and laid out our own plans on what we were going to do.

Because of last week's <a href="/devlog/mar-18-2025" class="inline-link">Chaos Jam</a>, we were not able to finish a "white-boxed" progression through all of the game's levels. This is okay, but it does worry me a little bit.

The team's programmers did work this week on trying to finish that over simplified progression through the entire game.

In our meeting, I also brought up my confusion on the main player motivations in our game. After talking it out for a second, we were able to articulate the two main motivations that we will plan for: Trying to climb the corporate ladder at ERASE, and trying to sabotage ERASE. While I think I already knew these things, talking about it helped me know it.

The rest of the week was spent reformatting the flowchart I've been using to plan our game, working on designing the final level's appearance, and experimenting with some new architectural designs for our game's levels.
