This week I really got to dig into laying out levels in our game. Trying to build levels has made me realize just how much work level design really is! It takes a surprisingly long time to arrange what would seem like a simple room. And of course our game's levels are not simple, -though that part is my fault (hehe).

I did not get as much done as I would have liked, but maybe I can tackle more of the level design this weekend. I want our game to have lots of content to explore, but that means I have a lot of work to do.

One of our team's programmers spent a few days (and still is) working on the gravity functionality. We want our player to be able to walk on walls, but that mechanic has proven to be surprisingly difficult. Our programmer had to figure out how to bypass Unreal Engine's normal settings in order to allow them to completely rotate the game's camera. The technical details are above me, but I'm really excited because what I've been seeing is super promising.

I spent more time designing tasks for our game too. Some of this work has proven to be longer and more tedious than I thought. A lot of it has to do with the fact that I want the player to willingingly go into most parts of our game, but that means I need to give the player the option to refuse things. This results in a myriad of alternate NPC dialogues and game content in order to naturally allow the player to have multiple consequential options. It just takes time to organize, but I think it'll be worth it.

Also, despite having already learned a bit about texel density, I still found myself stumped. After being taught some, I learned how to neatly calculate the texel density of a 2D asset. No longer do I need to measure things by the height of the player! The greatly improves my communication to artists.

hi. I'll get to this in a moment...
