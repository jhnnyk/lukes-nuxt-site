Good morning and welcome to Luke's blog! _confetti noises_. Perhaps one of the best things we did this week was have two solid team meetings. In the first, I initially agreed with one of our coders, and suggested polisihing a game jam project for our portofolios. But one of our artists brought up the amazing point that it would probably be best to finish any portfolio stuff after we can get our game finished. This simple suggestion set our course for the week, and I think it was the right call. Obviously our game is the priority because it has the soonest deadline, so it's smart to save some of our other tasks for later.

The second good meeting we had was very short. One of our coders brought up that due to our upcoming game jam (more on that later), as well as spring break, our time to work would be limited. So I cut the plan down from finishing a playable version of the game by the end of this month, to instead pushing for a playable version of our game <i>without all of the task minigames</i> by the end of the month.

The rest of my time mainly consisted of trying to plot out the rest of our game. For some reason, I found myself hitting writer's block while doing this. I've been focusing my energy on trying to hit a certain 'liminal' feeling with our game. Instead, I was able to continue moving once I "loosened up" and started being a little sillier. I added a GIFF to our game plan flowchart. For whatever reason, that simple action helped get me moving again.

I think going forward, instead of trying to pursure a weird 'liminal' feeling (one that slightly embarrases me, if I'm being honest), I want to focus on the strange sillyness that initially brought people onto this project. And, if I'm able, maybe I can still leave a few moments of viceral/surreal/wimsy/desire-for-peace in the game too.
