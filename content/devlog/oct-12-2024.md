This week was pretty productive, our team mostly finishing the DEMO we've been working on. While the DEMO is super simple, it lays the groundwork for much of the project's functionality. It took longer than hoped, and there's some game-breaking bugs, but after this week, we finally have something sort of playable.

Along the way, a new teammate joined our team. The new member specializes in 2D art, so we were excited to be able to have someone who would work on the game's necessary 2D graphics. However, I quickly found that I was not used to making design documentation for a 3D artist. I did not even think about how a 2D artist would want to know if something should be hand-drawn or not...

We had a couple of hick-ups, eventually deciding to make one in-game object completely 2D. This process was confusing, but it did get our team to a place where adding images to 3D models makes a lot more sense. I don't understand all the technical jargon, but now our artists have a better idea of what to do in order to put a 2D image on a 3D object.

Throughout this week, I also improved the game's design documentation. The written work stating how our game's setting should look is much more comprehensive, and now there's also way better documentaiont stating how the game's setting works.

<h1>MATH: Functions</h1>

I'm still not sure if this is the correct category of math for what I wanna write about. Welcome back to the MATH SEGMENT, where we're talking about logic!

Making our game's DEMO has led to making a pretty thorough flowchart detailing all of the options a player has. Lots of logical relationships. In this MATH SEGMENT, I want to talk about how organizing the logic of the game can allow the player to make sneaky decisions, things that don't seem fair.

This week, I made a flowchart describing a task in our game where the player is prompted with delivering a file to a shredder in order to destroy it. I made two separate flowcharts, one describing the logic of interacting with the shredder, and another with the NPC.

<img src="/images/erase-shredder-flowchart.png">

For this in-game "task", the player has to talk to an NPC in order to be prompted with the option of taking the task. Then, they have to take the task, which grants them the file. From there, the player can return to the NPC, and state that the file has been disposed of, a 'YES' to which tells the game that the player has completed the task.

However, in this logic, note that the game never requires the player to do anything with the acutal file. All of the logical statements are based on how the player responds to NPC dialogue; they can do anything they want with the actual file. This allows the player to lie about what they are doing with the file they've been asked to dispose of.

While allowing the player to lie seems stupid, it makes the player feel more free, and can introduce more complex problems later down the line.

While planning out a game, carefully organizing what events are connected to others is super important. If we had defined the completion of this task by the file actually being destoryed, the player would not be able to lie about doing it.

This specific organization of logic has also greatly influenced our DEMO. Our project's DEMO phase, as we're calling it, is essentially a much more complicated version of the above interactions. We have to be careful what events are tied to other events, otherwise we end up with confusing bugs that result in confusing nonsense.

So there you have it, organizing logic carefully in order to allow our players to be dishonest. Pretty MATH-y, right?

Well, that's all for today, have a good one.
