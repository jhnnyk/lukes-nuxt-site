This development log coveres the week, spanning from October 28th to today, November 2nd. I honestly feel like I dropped the ball as a designer this week, failing to provide clear plans for the game's characters, story and feel. But I suppose failing is how one learns.

Designing characters for our game was difficult. I originally wanted a diverse cast of NPCs, but that proved to be an enourmous workload, so we ended up pivoting. We decided that the characters should be simple variations on a grey humanoid, that way we can create lots of unique characters without doing a truckload of work.

If I'm being honest, I think I was trying to make myself look "commendable" and "cultured" by pushing for more diverse characters, but in reality some of our efforts were just a drag on the project because the idea wasn't very feasible. Making a large number of completely customized NPCs turns out to be a <i>lot</i> of work. Just goes to show how trying to impress others can get in the way... However, I think we also learned a good deal about character deisgn, so at least it wasn't all for nothing.

But part of the problem remains, because I still sit on the fence on how exactly the NPCs in our game should be. I originally wanted everyone to be different, but now I feel conflicted because I don't want our game to feel too much like the TV show <i>Fired on Mars</i> (2023), one of our game's influences.

And I never really got to actually finalizing the direction for the characteres of our game, because I felt preoccupied with designing the layout of an area in our game. I pretty quickly found out that laying out a level in Unreal Engine is slightly more involved than I thought.

Despite the difficulties, I learned a lot, and feel much more confident about designing this new area of our game. I'll tell you more these level design challenges in one of the below MATH SEGMENTS.

All of these things got me thinking about what our game should be. Despite the lack of direction I've been feeling, there is one thing I feel pretty confident about. Our game's feel. And after some thought, I think I have finally found a way to communicate the "feel," at least partially. I imagine our game as something similar to experiences I've had wandering empty rooms in large unfamiliar buildings. The sense of exploring somewhere I might not be allowed to be in is appealing to me, and I like being able to wonder about what goes on in said buildings.

<h1>MATH SEGMENT: Numbers, Coordinate Space Transforms</h1>

I promised above that I would elaborate on my level designing endeavors. I learned that a good way to do this was by simply typing in the locations of my game's actors. Punching in the coordinates of everything worried me, however, because I thought I'd have to perform lots of calculations to correctly lay out things.

It turned out that I was correct. One challenge, for example, was when an object was rotated. I ended up having to swap which local axis I altered in order to move something in the same global direction. This felt tedious, but I learned other, significant tips.

Firstly, when laying out levels, one arranges everything in the level roughly at first, and then, knowing where things go, you can do all of the math once, instead of having to redo things each time you make a small change to the level layout.

Secondly, I learned that I needed to ask our team's 3D modelers to make sure the origins of the game's models were in a bottom corner. The origin of an asset is the point that represents the asset's location. For a lot of our assets, this was in the center of our models. The reason I want to switch to putting our assets' origins in the bottom corners is to make the necessary calculations much simpler. For example, I'll explain what I was doing if I wanted to place two assets next to eachother whose origins were in those object's centers:

First, I had to find the first asset's location, and then add half of that asset's width to the appropriate coordinate in order to get the location directly next to that asset. Then I would have to add half of the second asset's width to the coordinate to find the appropriate location to move the second asset to in order for both assets to be direclty next to each other. This was annoying, and by simply making an asset's listed location be from the corner means I only need to add the first asset's width to the coordinate to find the right location for the adjacent second asset.

This whole process was pretty annoying to me, but it taught me a good bit, and now I feel much more equipped to design a level using coordinates.
