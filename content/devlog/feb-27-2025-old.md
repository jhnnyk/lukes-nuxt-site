You're looking at an outdated version of this webpage!!

Go to the much cooler and more current version <a class="inline-link" href="/feb-27-2025">here</a>!

<!-- READ the paragraph below here! -->

I made the newer version separate from my normal blog posts because I needed to make it a .vue file, rather than one of the typical markdown files.
