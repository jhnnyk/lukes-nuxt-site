Our upcoming project review (looming threat: tomorrow!) has been a little bit scary, but we have been getting work done. We are trying to set up our updated demo with connection to our progress on Floor 2 for our review, so we've been going through some different bug fixes and tweaks to make things neat for review.

I have continued level design. The stuff I've been doing for our second level (Floor 2) has been turning out great, and I'm excited for people to get to explore it!

I have also been working on our game documentation. At times, it seems that a pure project manger couldn't possibly have enough work to do. Now is not one of those times, haha! I am learning how easy it is for things to get disorganized, and now I wish I had taken more time to more thoroughly learn our kanban software. So learn from me kids, learn how to use your tools!

Yes! More level design! This time, I actually ran into a sort of interesting design problem though.

I wanted to create a room with stuff on the ceiling, so I though, "oh yeah, I'll just duplicate this room and rotate it 180&deg; to put on top." This all seemed jolly and well, but the room wasn't perfectly symmetrical! This meant that rotating the room 180&deg; aligned the opposite sides of the room atop each other, and sense they weren't the same things didn't line up.

In the end, I had to fudge things together in order to make it work.

Keeping in mind asymmetry while rotating things is important, at least in this scenario, to me.

Additionally, I continued with all of the usual use of coordinates, scaling and rotating cubes, some parent objects having things attached to them, and using grid snapping. Hopefully I'm just getting better and better at making levels.
