Last week was a doozy. I apologize for my lateness on this post. I continue to feel weighed down by my own procrastination and fear, but our project is developing fairly well. Perhaps the only thing weighing me down is my own fear of being weighed down...

Reflective musings aside, you can now play through the first two waves of tasks in our game, and progress has continued surprisingly well. Our team's programmers and artists are doing a great job, and I believe we will have a half-decent amount of content by the deadline continually approaching deadline.

We had meetings as a group about how to create resumes for game development, which was insightful. I am reluctant to work on a resume, but I can see the importance (sigh). We were also informed about our weekly project reviews which will be held now as our deadline is approaching. We had a fairly successful project review this week, and our team held a meeting to talk about everything we needed to add/fix, and our plan going forward.

This week, I have really been developing my "write down what we need, then put it on our project management software" system. I have been more diligently writing down bugs and additional things to add as they come up, and adding them to our to-do list. This helps me stay more organized, and keeps our project management software relevant. Following this system strictly means I don't have to remember as much, and I have been enjoying making use of it this week.

I spent some time this week implementing one of our artist's new light models. The previous light models buldged up too much, which the lights stick out through above floors.

To implement the new light models, which bulge out only a little bit, I have had to redo a lot of ceiling space to make "holes" to place our indented lights in.

Making each light sit into the ceiling proved to look much nicer, and took some experimenting (and inspiration) to find. While making each light sit into the ceiling takes more work, it looks much more natural, so I think it is worth it.

Doing lighting in Unreal Engine is pretty tricky. The <i>biggest</i> thing I grappled with while making these lights was what settings to make the actual lighting use. Our lights are actually the model mixed with one of Unreal's point lights just in front of the model, giving the impression that our model is producing the light.

I realized I couldn't make the area that the light's source radius too big, otherwise the light would poke out of the ceiling above it (which is bad when we have multiple floors). Making the attenuation radius (the area that the light affects) too big also made the lighting more expensive to compute.

I could also make the intensity of the light greater, resulting in a brighter light, but that would often make the lights themselves appear much too intense when looked at.

Struggling to find desireable settings with these lights, I actually modified our level's Post Process Volume to make <i>everything</i> brighter. Our current lighting still looks pretty bad though, so we clearly have lots to learn about lighting in Unreal.

I tested out a variety of different settings to light our world, and was able to find something "okay enough" for now. It would definitely do me good to take a deeper dive into Unreal Engine 5's lighting.
