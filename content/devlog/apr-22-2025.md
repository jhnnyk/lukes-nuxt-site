Last week was a doozy. I apologize for my lateness on this post. I continue to feel weighed down by my own procrastination and fear, but our project is developing fairly well. Perhaps the only thing weighing us down is my own fear of being weighed down...

Reflective musings aside, you can now play through the first two waves of tasks in our game, and progress has continued surprisingly well. Our team's programmers and artists are doing a great job, and I believe we will have a half-decent amount of content by the deadline continually approaching deadline.

We had meetings as a group about how to create resumes for game development, which was insightful. I am reluctant to work on a resume, but I can see the importance (sigh). We were also informed about our weekly project reviews which will be held now as our deadline is approaching. We had a fairly successful project review this week, and our team held a meeting to talk about everything we needed to add/fix.

This week, I have really been developing my "write down what we need then put it on our project management software" system. I have been more diligently writing down bugs and additional things to add as they come up, and adding them to our to-do list. This helps me stay more organized, and keeps our project management software relevant. Following this system strictly means I don't have to remember as much, and I have been enjoying making use of it this week.

I also worked on making a light Blueprint in UE5 to implement the model one of our artists made.
