Perhaps the summary headings for today's post are too vague. Oh well. But today, on tonight's blog post, we've got a great show comin' up! Soon to be revealed is our new MATH SEGMENT, so buckle up and get ready for a WILD ride! But first, writing.

I got a decent summary of our game's story finished, but there's lots of details yet to be fleshed out. I think the story I wrote is much too ambitious, but we'll see. Things have been taking a good while, but if we work hard, I think we can produce something that is pretty cool. I am a little disappointed we only get one school year to work on this project.

I spent a good amount of time reading through an architecture book, and taking notes on things that seem potentially relevant to me. I've been looking into Modernist architecture, and I've been enjoying it quite a lot. I'm also looking forward to reading about Postmodernist architecture! There's some cool ideas that hopefully we can implement into our game's world!

More time was also spent helping the team, and seeing what they were up to. It took our artists a long time to figure out that there was a better software for putting images on 3D models...

One problem has come up though. I'm glad I spent some time working on additional game features past our DEMO phase, because as multiple coders work on most of the files, our other coder was left unable to work on main features. I feel I've let down my team for not having more crucial parts of the game fleshed out, but did have <i>something</i> for them to work on. Somehow, I always feel like I'm behind on the design. I think I should just dedicate a lot more time to fleshing out all of the game's features and world. That would do us all some good, I think.

AND NOW!!!!! For this blog's first ever...

<h1>MATH: Functions</h1>

Welcome to the MATH SEGMENT, where I keep you up to date on some of my more "numerical" work.

The main math I've been doing as a designer involves <i>logic</i>. Because we are created a game that largely reacts based on the player's actions, we need to organize a lot of the game's events around different possible outcomes. Given a plyer response, the game needs to be able to react differently, producing different outputs.

The simple way I have been plotting this out is with flowcharts, diagrams that show all of the branches in player decisions. Creating a game this way creates multiple design problems, however.

Having so many branches creates lots of content that needs to be created! Even with simple 2-choice responses that lead to new events with 2 choices, the number of possible game events we could create quickly grows, doubling with each new step we would want to make.

By having the in-game events merge in with each other, ultimately leading to the same points with different ways of the getting there, the player is given an experience that feels unique to their actions, while also managing the workload into something more manageable.

The above example image includes 3 prompts for player responses with 6 possible choices. However, there is only 4 unique events. Having the event branches merge back in with each other, the player feels like they have one or two choices, and we don't have to create a million game events.

Another sneakier technique is to have "fake" responses that do not actually affect the outcome of events, but just make the player feel in control.

Another interesting thing we implemented is "conditional events". The player can do a variety of things, but certain events can only happen if the right conditions are met. For example, we might want some part of the game to require a special item to unlock. This creates a new branch in our flowchart, but one that can only be accessed if the player has the special item.

By having events wait for player requirements, we can still manage the in-game events neatly, but it also gives the player the feeling that they are in a dynamic world. If we allow the player to remake choices, but notice that their new item gives them a new option, hopefully it makes the world seem responsive and that item feel useful!

To put it simply, we are allowing the player to go through the same options multiple times, but in the way that they choose. This creates an incredibly large number of possible "timelines" that the player can take, requiring a much smaller number of actual events.

This kind of design work requires envisioning the story on both a linear and nonlinear level, accounting for how a player might end up in a given cirumstance. This MATH SEGMENT is not super math heavy, but hopefully it is of some use to you.

As always, you read something. Hooray.
