It's been a few days since I last wrote a blog post. We were asked to write posts about our experiences from the game jam we did, and since I already did that in <a class="inline-link" href="/devlog/sep-28-2024">September 28's</a> entry, I will keep this one shorter. We were also tasked to write brief articles about the math we do. Math? Ew! Gross! I don't do math! I don't have do write about math as often, so I am going to put it off until later this week, because I am a little busier today.

Our game jam went well. We got off to a rough start, spending a long time to decide what we wanted to do. Part of this was because I was not clear with everyone else form the start on what game I was willing to make, so next time I do a game jam I definately want to waste no time going along with an idea I don't want to work on.

Despite the rough disagreements about what kind of game we should make
