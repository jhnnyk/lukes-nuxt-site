I did some good work on our game's Demo level map. Now it's in a state where it feels decently complete, and I will plan to move on to working on the game's next levels. It took time to set up some of the pieces that I can copy paste, and I wish I made better use of Unreal Engine's grid snapping when laying assets out, but all in all, I think it's pretty good. It's inspiring when the team likes what I've done. Can't wait to work on the second level!!

One of our team's artists did some awesome work on a "mind monitor machine" model. They then made a <i>very</i> nice animation for it, which one of our programmers implemented this week. Seeing all of this work come together is very nice.

All of us designers got together and began reviewing two kids' design documentation. And wow. It was fun to read, yet also explanatory. They had two of their in-game characters explaining parts of the game, which not only helped make it more fun to read, but it also gave you an increased understanding of the game's mood.

To be honest, I have neglected my own game's design documentation because people haven't been making the most use of it, and I don't have organized in a helpful manner. Of course, the typical format that we've been learning all this time makes way more sense, and would be better than <i>whatever it is I've done</i>. I've hid from the documentation, but I should have asked for help, and used the <i>default format</i>. Wow wow wow, wow wow.

Why do I run from my problems when I could run <i>at</i> them?

As mentioned above, I have a pass of our game's first level (the demo map) that could work as "complete enough."

To build the final area, I made a large cafeteria-like area with "coves" along the walls. To give it a stranger, more "liminal" feel, I made the room extend unusually long.

<span class="image-desc">As you can see, the cafe area goes back pretty far.</span>

One somewhat interesting thing I've been running into (since I've started doing level design) is when you rotate an rectangular object from an origin at one of its corners. The locations of actors in Unreal Engine are measured at a point, and so if you rotate an actor, you're spinning it about that actor's origin point (the point that is where the location is measured from).

This means that when you rotate, say, a cube, 180&deg;, you need to make sure that the cube doesn't appear shifted over. The rotation could end up with the depth of the cube on the opposite side of the point that you want, so you might need to adjust the cube's position in order to rotate it properly. I've ran into this a lot when rotating walls and things: I'll twist a wall 180&deg; and find I need to offset it's location slightly because the depth of the wall is on the "wrong" side of its origin.

<span class="image-desc">All of the above cubes have the same position on the y-axis (green), but they're rotated different amounts.</span>

The above image illustrates this by showing 5 cubes, all with the same position on the y-axis (green). Because they're being rotated about a corner, the cube ends up in an "offset" position when it's rotated 180&deg;.

I guess the moral of the story is to pay attention to what point an actor's location is be measured from, and to keep in mind how rotation works with that. Interestingly, if the origin was at the cube's center, there would be no "offset"; the cube would "spin in place".

Working on this level, I was also forced to work with more focus on precision. I "chillaxed" some and began measuring less precisely. That bit me in the back a little bit becauase odd seams appeared between adjacent walls. It took taking the time to properly measure a few things to get the clean result I wanted.

<span class="image-desc">Look at that neat stairwell! Ignore the funky shadow that the railing casts...</span>

But now, I can say I have some pride in my work.
