# Projects

The place to find various projects I have worked on. Right now, everything you'll find here was created in collaboration with artists, programmers, designers, and other people who aren't myself.

I hope to fill this page with more projects later, though out of everything I've worked on, my favorite is <i>The Hunt</i> (2025), which is available to play on mac and windows.
