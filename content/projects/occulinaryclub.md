# The ocCulinary Club

A project produced during a two week game jam (initially one week but it got extended) based on the prompt <i>Paralyzed!</i> in September 2024. I got to work with some amazing people: Cade, Luma Volta, Royce Reinwald, and Vixen.

We ended up creating a crypit ARG with a weird spooky mystery. Unfortunately, our project turned out to be way too crypitic for anybody to make sense of. Because of this, as of December 2024, I improved some things that will hopefully make the game at least slightly playable.

Well, if you enjoy strange crypitic games with puzzles that are hard in all of the least fun ways, perhaps you'll get a kick out of our game.
