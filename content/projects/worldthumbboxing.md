# World Thumb Boxing

World Thumb Boxing was the unfinished game jam project for the December 2024 "Relentless" jam. It was worked on by Dillan Gray, Declan Mahoney, Magnus Wiese, Luke Knotts, and "ghost".

It was planned to be a Punch Out-inspired fighting game, where two thumbs duke it out in a fight. I even wrote some music for the project:

<span class="image-desc">The second I piece I made (much more quickly). I think the simplicity might make this one better than the first piece.</span>

However, I think because we never pulled the mechanics down into a playable state, we weren't able to create a complete project by the end of the jam.

I wrote about it more in-depth in <a class="inline-link" src="/devlog/dec-17-2024">this</a> blog post.

You can also check out our (mostly) empty itch.io page for the project:
